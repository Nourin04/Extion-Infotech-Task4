# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! ðŸŽ¥

## Overview

This project was developed during my internship as a Machine Learning Intern at Bharat Intern. The goal was to create a system that provides personalized movie recommendations based on user input.

## Project Description

The Movie Recommendation System leverages machine learning techniques to suggest movies that are similar to the one provided by the user. The system works by analyzing a movies dataset and utilizing various libraries such as *Numpy, **Pandas, **Difflib, **TfidfVectorizer, and **Cosine Similarity*.

### Key Features:
- *User Input*: Enter your favorite movie, and the system will find the closest match.
- *Personalized Recommendations*: Get a list of movies that are similar to your favorite one.
- *Feature Engineering*: The system selects relevant features, replaces null values with a null string, and combines these features for analysis.
- *Text Vectorization*: Converts text data into numerical feature vectors using TfidfVectorizer.
- *Similarity Scoring*: Measures the similarity between movies using Cosine Similarity.

### How It Works:
1. *Selecting Relevant Features*: Identifying the key attributes for movie recommendations.
2. *Handling Missing Data*: Replacing null values with a null string.
3. *Combining Features*: Merging selected features into a single dataset.
4. *Vectorizing Text*: Transforming text data into feature vectors.
5. *Calculating Similarity*: Using Cosine Similarity to determine the closeness between movies.
6. *User Interaction*: Taking input from the user for their favorite movie.
7. *Finding Closest Match*: Searching for the closest match to the user input within the dataset.
8. *Generating Recommendations*: Producing a list of movies similar to the userâ€™s choice.
9. *Displaying Results*: Showing the recommended movies sorted by their similarity scores.
